DMC - Todo Application

This is a simple todo application which promised a fast server response time. As of the moment, optimizing the client load time by only loading components accessed by the users is not yet implemented. Realtime capabalities of the application would be implemented soon through Socket IO!

This application has been developed through the MERN tech stack. The use of a non-relation database is fitting to the application as it will horizontally scale as the number of users grow overtime.
